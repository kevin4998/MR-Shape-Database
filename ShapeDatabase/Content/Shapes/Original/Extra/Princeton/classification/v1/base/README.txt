Base Classification
===================

This classification divides the models into a training and test set
with fine grained classes, each with 907 models.  The
classification spans a large variety of classes including animals,
plants, airplanes, furniture, vehicles, etc.

The categorization has a multiple level hierarchy described in the
.cla classification document. The first levels of the hierarchy are
based on the gross function of the model, while the remaining levels
of the hierarchy distinguish between models based on geometric shape.

There are some categories that do not have any models directly, but
serve as the parent classes of more specific categories.
