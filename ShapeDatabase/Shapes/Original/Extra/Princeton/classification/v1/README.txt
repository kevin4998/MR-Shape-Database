Classification V1
=================

Classification version 1 corresponds to a full classification for
1,814 models.  There is a base classification that
separates a training and test set, and most users are likely to use
this classification.  Other granularities of classification are
provided in folder coarse1, coarse2, and coarse3, which provider
coarser versions of the base classification.  Coarse1 merges classes
from the fine-grained base classification.  Coarse2 further merges
classes to create seven basic classes, and coarse3 has only two
classes, natural and manmade.  See the README.txt file in each folder
for more information.
