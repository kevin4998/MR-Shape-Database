Coarse1 Classification
===================

This classification divides the models into a training and test set
with coarser grained classes, each with 907 models.  The
classification spans a large variety of classes including animals,
plants, airplanes, furniture, vehicles, etc.  A difference from the
base classification is that semantically similar categories have been
merged.  

The categorization has a multiple level hierarchy described in the
.cla classification document.

serve as the parent classes of more specific categories.
