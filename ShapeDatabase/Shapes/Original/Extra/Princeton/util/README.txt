Util
====

Free source code is provided for processing .off geometry files and
.cla classification files.  See the README.txt file in each
subdirectory for more details about each application.  Below is a
short summary.


claoverview
==============
Verifies .cla classification files and creates web page overviews of
classification files.

clastats
========
Reads in a .cla classification file and prints statistics about 
the classification.

offviewer
=========
Provides a graphical interface for viewing .off files.  The 3D model
can be rotated and manipulated in the viewer.

offstats
========
Reads in a .off geometry file for a model and prints statistics about
the model.

psbPlot
=======
Creates a precision recall plot of the performance of a descriptor on
the task of retrieval.

psbTable
========
Creates statistics analyzing the performance of a descriptor on
retrieval. Nearest neighbor, first tier, second tier, E-measure, and discounted
cumulative gain are calculated.

printmatrix
===========
Opens a distance matrix and prints the values to the screen. 

bestMatch
=========
Produces web pages to view the retrieval results for each query model.

SimMat
======
Creates .gif images of the distance matrix and color images of the
first and second tier retrieval results.
